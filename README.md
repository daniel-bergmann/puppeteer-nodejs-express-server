# puppeteer-nodejs-express-server

## A I used puppeteer to web scrape info on amazon and made a node server with express.



### For installation clone the repo and in the command line, run:

 ```bash
 npm install
 ```

 or with yarn:

  ```bash
 yarn
 ```

 and then to start the server run: 

 ```bash
 node .
 ```
 
 You should then see the data console logged in the terminal.
 
 I also made an API which you can view on localhost:5000/api
